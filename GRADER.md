No points taken off overall

common MakeFile does not have an apropriate clean rule. I have to clean it from the top level in order to remake it -1 point
9/10

### Documentation

-.5 testing.sh does not have comments regarding the reasoning behind each test
9.5/10

Test script is rather short(Only 4 test). No testing of bad commandline arguments or other edge cases. No test at depth 0.
testing.sh 4/8
testing.out 2/2
6/10
