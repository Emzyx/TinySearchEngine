### Usage
**./crawler [seedURL][pageDirectory][maxDepth]**

To test the the files using the Makefile, you can simply try _make test_
or to add the results to a file, _make test &> testing.out_
If you want to use each test case individually just use _make test#_ where "#" is the number of test you'd like to run.

Also, _make test_ runs several tests at the same time, so if you'd like to test one at a time, run _make test#_ where *#* is a specific number between from 1 to 4, inclusive.

### Assumptions

Some assumptions one could make, is that everything works as it should (which it most likely will and has been working since Prof. Kotz provided it).
