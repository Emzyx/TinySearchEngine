<h1>Computer Science 50 demonstration page</h1>

This is the "home page" for user <tt>cs50</tt> on the CS-department servers.
It is not the same as the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/">course website</a> because that actually runs on a different server, and requires an encrypted connection.
